.SS Editing a file
Enter an editing mode by typing 'e' (for ASCII edit) or 'E' for hex
edit. The cursor may be moved either by the arrow keys or the vi-style
^H, ^J, ^K, ^L keys, depending on compilation options. Place the cursor
on the byte to change and type either a printing ASCII character or two
digit hex value. Exit either edit mode by typing ^E. When you are
satisfied with your editing, enter the W command to write the modified
portion of the file back to disk.

.SS Searching for data
You may search for hex data by giving the h command and entering a
string of hex digits. The search procedes forward from the current
location until a matching string is found. The display is adjusted to
put the first byte at the top of the screen (but see configuration
options). If no pattern is specified the previous pattern is used.
.P
To search for a string, enter the F (for find) command, or the vi style
/ command. At the prompt type in a string and press return. The search
procedes as with a hex byte search. If you wish to repeat a string
search, enter the F command again and press return. This will repeat the
search for the previous string. If the starting position has not been
adjusted the search will start one character past the location of the
last occurence found.
.SS Configuration options
The makefile contains configuration option, identifiable by comments.
These are all at the top of the makefile. If your curses supports KEYPAD
definition for your terminal, you may use the cursor keys on the keypad.
This is generally only found in SysV systems with termlib versions of
curses. If you don't have that feature the NOKEYPAD option will allow
use of vi style cursor keys.
.P
When searching, if you prefer to see the pattern in context you may set
the CLINES to the number of lines of context displayed before the
pattern found. This may cause problems doing hex searches. In addition,
if you want the display to start on a 16 byte boundary, to match od or
hd output, you may enable the ALLIGN option.
.SH WARNINGS
Illegal commands are flagged as such.
.SH SEE ALSO
od, hd, possibly adb.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SH LIMITATIONS
If the l or L commands are used with no pattern specified before a
pattern has been specified the value zero will be used.
