This is Version 1.1 for the BPE Program I wrote some time ago,
there has been some bug fixes(tks to maart@cs.vu.nl).

To generate the new Version of the BPE program type

	ed <bpe.diffs bpe.c

then look at the new makefile, and correct the NKEYPAD value to
suit for your System. 



Any further comments and bug reports are welcomed.

Comments on v1.2:

  The changes to work without KEYPAD defined failed on my system. After
making changes to get them functional, I rewrote part of the makefile. I
wanted to have found strings in context, so I added an option to leave
some data before the found string. I also added an option to start the
display after find on a 16 byte boundary to allow matching with other
dumps.

  Then I added search for a byte, since I wanted that several times
while debugging, and finally after trying to move it to a BSD system I
changed the "end edit" key to ^E instead of ^C, since ^C is normally the
interrupt character on most of the systems I use, and signals are
ignored. The CTRL macro wasn't quite correct, and I cleaned up the
gethex procedure, which didn't quite work on my systems.

  Oh yes, I wrote a man page for it, too. I still have a wish list if
anyone feels ambitious.

I sent my changes back to the original author, and he sent me *his*
version 1.2 with other enhancements over 1.1. He asked me to merge them,
and after looking at his changes and mine I added the code to find a hex
string to my code. We had fixed many of the same things and my makefile
seemed a bit cleaner. I also added a number of shell scripts to perform
makes, including MS-DOS. The man page has been updated to reflect the
combined version.
